# WhyCon
## A precise, efficient and low-cost localization system

_WhyCon_ is a vision-based localization system that can be used with low-cost web cameras, and achieves millimiter precision with very high performance.
These characteristics allow its use as an alternative to more expensive localization systems available. 
The system is capable of efficient real-time detection and precise position estimation of several circular markers in a video stream. 
It can be used both off-line, as a source of ground-truth for robotics experiments, or on-line as a component of robotic systems that require real-time, precise position estimation.
_WhyCon_ is meant as an alternative to widely used and expensive localization systems. It is fully open-source.

The _WhyCon_ system was developed as a joint project between the University of Buenos Aires, Czech Technical University and University of Lincoln, UK.
The main contributors were [Matias Nitsche](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z0hQoRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Jan Faigl](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-finD_sAAAAJ&hl=en). Each of these contributors maintains a slightly different version of WhyCon.

####How does it work ?

A six-page overview of the <i>WhyCon</i> system was first presented at the ICAR conference [[1](#references)].
A detailed description was published in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotics Systems [[2](#references)].
An overview of _WhyCon's_ applications was presented at the Workshop on Open Source Aerial Robotics during the International Conference on Intelligent Robotic Systems, 2015 [[3](#references)].
Nowadays, the system is being used in several research projects the across globe, see the following video for examples.

####Can I use it ?
 
If you decide to use this _WhyCon_ for your research, please cite it using the one of the references provided in this [bibtex](https://github.com/lrse/whycon/blob/master/cite.bib) file.
Note that this .bib includes not only the references to the scientific works that describe the underlying method, but also a reference to the implementation for a specific (stable) version of the code on GitHub (look for the DOI containing the word "zenodo").

## Installing WhyCon

The code can be compiled either as a ROS package (shared library) or in a standalone version.

**NOTE**: while the standalone version includes a demo application, this demo is not actively maintained anymore and will probably be removed soon. The reference application is provided as a series of ROS nodes, which utilize the _WhyCon_ shared library. For an example of how to implement your own standalone application, see the ROS node.

Stable [releases](https://github.com/lrse/whycon/releases) are available periodically. Latest stable release can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/lrse/whycon/releases/latest). 

For the latest development version (which should also work and may contain new experimental features) you can clone the repository directly.

### ROS

The main directory should be placed inside a catkin workspace source-space (e.g.: ~/catkin_ws/src).
It can then be compiled simply by:

    catkin_make

### Standalone

The standalone version requires you to take care of installing the correct dependencies: OpenCV and Boost. If you are on Ubuntu, simply perform the following:

    sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libboost-all-dev

The installation process is really straightforward, as with any CMake based project.
Inside the main directory do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DDISABLE_ROS=ON ..
    make

The code can be installed to the system by doing:

    make install

Note the default CMake location is `/usr/local`, but you can redefine this by invoking cmake in this way instead:

    cmake -DDISABLE_ROS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
